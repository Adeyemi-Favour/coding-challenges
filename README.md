My approach entails: 
1. Creating a function that takes the sequence or string as an argument
2. Converting the sequence to lowercase and replacing the non-alphanumeric characters with '' (literally nothing)
3. Declared an empty list to accommodate each character of the sequence
4. A for loop was used to add each character to the empty list created
5. Used if condition, (.join()) and reversed function to compare if the characters are the same when reversed
